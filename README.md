## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## No mobile

This site was primarily made to work on desktop screens, due to the time pressure of putting the project together. At some point I'll take the time to fix up some bugs and make it work on mobile as well. It's not a good reason, but that's what I got the time for right now.
